This project encompasses the server simulation of a notepad blog, operating with Node.js and Express. Within the code, you'll find two distinct SQL queries.
The first query retrieves notes from a table, while the second one creates a new note within the same table. 
This table resides in a PostgreSQL database hosted in the cloud through `https://www.elephantsql.com/`.

Credentials to access with pgAdmin.
